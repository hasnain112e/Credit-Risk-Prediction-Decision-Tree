# Credit-Risk-Prediction-Decision-Tree
A machine learning project to predict credit risk (High Risk / Low Risk) using a Decision Tree Classifier. The project uses the German Credit dataset to train a classification model, evaluates it with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualizes the decision tree for interpretability.
